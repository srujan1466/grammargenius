        <h1>Direct and Indirect Speech</h1>

        <p>When we communicate what someone else has said, we can use either direct speech or indirect speech (also called reported speech). Understanding the rules and differences between these two forms is essential for clear and accurate communication in English.</p>

        <h2>What is Direct Speech?</h2>
        <p>Direct speech repeats the exact words spoken by someone, using quotation marks. It presents the speaker's words exactly as they were spoken, preserving the original tone and immediacy of the statement.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Sarah said, "I am going to the store."
        </div>

        <h2>What is Indirect Speech?</h2>
        <p>Indirect speech (or reported speech) reports what someone said without using their exact words and without quotation marks. It involves changes in pronouns, verb tenses, and time or place references to accurately reflect the reporting context.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Sarah said (that) she was going to the store.
        </div>

        <h2>Key Differences</h2>
        <div class="key-differences">
            <div class="key-box direct-key">
                <h3>Direct Speech</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses quotation marks to enclose the exact words</li>
                    <li>Reports exact words as originally spoken</li>
                    <li>Preserves the original tense used by the speaker</li>
                    <li>Maintains original pronouns (I, you, we, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Keeps original time and place references (now, here, this, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Preserves the emotion and immediacy of the original statement</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="key-box indirect-key">
                <h3>Indirect Speech</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>No quotation marks are used</li>
                    <li>Paraphrases or summarizes what was said</li>
                    <li>Generally shifts verb tenses backward in time</li>
                    <li>Changes pronouns according to the reporting context</li>
                    <li>Adjusts time and place references (then, there, that, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Often includes a reporting clause with "that" (which can be omitted)</li>

        </div>

        <h2>Rules for Converting Direct to Indirect Speech</h2>

        <h3>1. Pronoun Changes</h3>
        <p>When converting from direct to indirect speech, pronouns often need to change based on the context and the reporter's perspective.</p>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Pronouns change according to the context of the reporting and the relationship between the speaker and the listener.</p>
        </div>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Direct Speech</th>
                <th>Indirect Speech</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"I am happy," he said.</td>
                <td>He said (that) he was happy.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"You are late," she told me.</td>
                <td>She told me (that) I was late.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"We will help you," they promised.</td>
                <td>They promised (that) they would help us/me.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"They have finished their work," he said.</td>
                <td>He said (that) they had finished their work.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>2. Tense Changes</h3>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of indirect speech is the backshift of tenses. When the reporting verb (said, told, asked, etc.) is in the past tense, the verb in the reported speech typically moves one tense back in time.</p>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule:</strong> When the reporting verb is in the past tense, shift the tense of the reported verb backward in time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Direct Speech</th>
                <th>Indirect Speech</th>
                <th>Tense Change</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Present Simple: "I work here."</td>
                <td>He said (that) he worked there.</td>
                <td>Present Simple → Past Simple</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Present Continuous: "I am studying."</td>
                <td>She said (that) she was studying.</td>
                <td>Present Continuous → Past Continuous</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Present Perfect: "I have finished."</td>
                <td>He said (that) he had finished.</td>
                <td>Present Perfect → Past Perfect</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Past Simple: "I visited Paris."</td>
                <td>She said (that) she had visited Paris.</td>
                <td>Past Simple → Past Perfect</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Future (will): "I will help."</td>
                <td>He said (that) he would help.</td>
                <td>Future (will) → Conditional (would)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the direct speech contains a past perfect tense, it remains the same in indirect speech.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I had already eaten," she said. → She said (that) she had already eaten.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Exception:</strong> If the reported content is still true at the time of reporting or is a universal truth, the tense may remain unchanged.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "The Earth revolves around the Sun," the teacher said. → The teacher said (that) the Earth revolves around the Sun.</p>

        <h3>3. Time and Place Reference Changes</h3>
        <p>Words that refer to time and place often need to change in indirect speech to reflect the different context of reporting.</p>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Adjust time and place references to reflect the perspective of the reporter at the time of reporting.</p>
        </div>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Direct Speech</th>
                <th>Indirect Speech</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>tomorrow</td>

        </table>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Direct:</strong> "I will see you tomorrow," he said.<br>
            <strong>Indirect:</strong> He said (that) he would see me the next day.
        </div>

        <h3>4. Modal Verb Changes</h3>
        <p>Modal verbs follow specific patterns when changing from direct to indirect speech, typically shifting to their past forms.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Direct Speech</th>
                <th>Indirect Speech</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>can</td>
                <td>could</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>may</td>
                <td>might</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>will</td>
                <td>would</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>shall</td>
                <td>should/would</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>must</td>
                <td>had to / must (obligation)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Direct:</strong> "I can swim," she said.<br>
            <strong>Indirect:</strong> She said (that) she could swim.
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> 'Could', 'might', 'should', 'would', 'ought to', and 'used to' remain the same in indirect speech as they are already past forms.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>5. Reporting Questions</h3>
        <p>When reporting questions, we use verbs like 'asked', 'inquired', 'wanted to know', etc., instead of 'said'. The word order changes to that of a statement, and question marks are removed.</p>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule for Yes/No Questions:</strong> Use 'if' or 'whether' to introduce the reported question.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Direct:</strong> "Do you like coffee?" he asked.<br>
            <strong>Indirect:</strong> He asked if/whether I liked coffee.
        </div>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule for Wh-Questions:</strong> Keep the question word (what, where, when, etc.) and change word order to statement form.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Direct:</strong> "Where do you live?" she asked.<br>
            <strong>Indirect:</strong> She asked where I lived.
        </div>

        <h3>6. Reporting Commands and Requests</h3>
        <p>Commands and requests are reported using the infinitive form. The reporting verbs commonly used are 'told', 'ordered', 'commanded', 'requested', 'asked', etc.</p>
        
        <div class="rule">
            <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Use 'to + infinitive' for positive commands and 'not to + infinitive' for negative commands.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Direct (Positive Command):</strong> "Open the window," he said.<br>
            <strong>Indirect:</strong> He told me to open the window.
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Direct (Negative Command):</strong> "Don't be late," she said.<br>
            <strong>Indirect:</strong> She told me not to be late.
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <strong>Direct (Request):</strong> "Please help me with this," he said.<br>
            <strong>Indirect:</strong> He asked/requested me to help him with that.
        </div>

        <h3>7. Reporting Suggestions and Offers</h3>
        <p>Suggestions and offers are typically reported using different reporting verbs like 'suggested', 'offered', 'proposed', etc.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Direct (Suggestion):</strong> "Let's go for a walk," she said.<br>
            <strong>Indirect:</strong> She suggested going for a walk.
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Direct (Offer):</strong> "Can I help you?" he said.<br>
            <strong>Indirect:</strong> He offered to help me.
        </div>

        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Forgetting to change pronouns appropriately based on the context</li>
            <li>Not shifting tenses when reporting past events (backshift rule)</li>
            <li>Neglecting to change time and place references</li>
            <li>Keeping question word order in reported questions</li>
            <li>Using quotation marks in indirect speech</li>
            <li>Using 'said to' instead of 'told' when mentioning the listener</li>
            <li>Forgetting that 'say' is used without an indirect object, while 'tell' requires one</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When in doubt about whether to use backshift in tenses, consider whether the reported statement is still true or relevant at the time of reporting. If it expresses a general truth or a continuing situation, the backshift may be optional.</p>
