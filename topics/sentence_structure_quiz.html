                answer: "She saw a rainbow looking out the window.",
                explanation: "This sentence is ambiguous because 'looking out the window' is placed in a way that could modify either the subject ('she') or the object ('rainbow'). Since rainbows don't look out windows, this is a misplaced modifier."

                answer: "The loud alarm rang suddenly.",
                explanation: "A simple sentence contains one independent clause with a subject and verb, and no dependent clauses. Even with modifiers like adjectives and adverbs, it remains a simple sentence."
